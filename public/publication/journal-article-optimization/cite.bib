abstract = {This research study investigates the optimization of a domestic hot water storage tank system integrated with a photovoltaic grid-tied setup using a power Diverter. The aim is to maximize self-consumption of PV-generated energy while maintaining safe water temperature above 55 °C. Pareto-efficient solutions were derived through multi-objective optimization, revealing an optimized configuration. This optimized configuration resulted in high self-consumption rate of 87 % and provided a 2190 h of hot water above the safety threshold. A comparative analysis was conducted against a reference system, demonstrating the advantages of the optimized system. The optimized system exhibited significant reductions of 46 % in auxiliary energy requirements and 20 % of energy losses as well as a carbon emissions reduction of 0.175 tons per year. These findings highlight the effectiveness of multi-objective optimization techniques in tailoring hot water storage systems. The optimized system enhances energy efficiency, reduces reliance on auxiliary power sources, and minimizes energy losses. Overall, the optimized PV water heater system offers promising strides towards sustainable and efficient domestic hot water energy solutions for domestic scale applications.}
