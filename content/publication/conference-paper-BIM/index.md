abstract: This paper presents the key points of an exploration conducted for a research focusing on finding the most suited BIM workflow for energy efficiency oriented retrofit of individual residential buildings. The research presented in this paper focuses on Binayate software tools and aims to explore what these tools provide as potential for the BIM (Building Information Modeling) paradigm and how much they can fit in a regular BIM workflow used in mainstream Architecture agencies. The conducted energy analysis is focused on energy efficiency oriented retrofitting for individual residential housing. Using a case study, the research consists mainly on three parts, drafting an overview of the possibilities offered by Binayate toolset, testing the interoperability of Binayate with other BIM software tools and comparing the results generated by Binayate with previous results conducted by TRNSYS and with data gathered in-situ post-retrofit. The results of this ongoing exploration so far show some positive outcomes, yet many limitations of Binayate 3D in terms of modeling, a lack of interoperability with between Binayate Performancielle, Binayate 3D and other BIM software tools and a gap of 17% between results generated by Binayate Performancielle and the results conducted with TRNSYS that helped achieve a successful case of energy efficiency oriented retrofit.
