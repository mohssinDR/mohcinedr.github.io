abstract: Building occupancy information is essential for effective energy management in buildings through the adoption of energy conservation and occupant-centric control strategies. These strategies endeavor to contribute to optimizing energy consumption while ensuring occupant comfort. This study focuses on advanced occupancy modeling techniques to enhance energy efficiency in residential buildings, utilizing various data-driven techniques. Various Machine Learning models, such as Random Forest, Bayesian Network, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and Regularized Greedy Forest, have been evaluated for predicting and classifying building occupancy. Employing a living lab approach within a residential setting, the research evaluates model performance using two ground truth datasets, IoT sensor and survey data. Experimental tests use Accuracy and F1_score as evaluation criteria, demonstrating accuracy rates ranging from 70% to 95.96%. The results highlight the performance of these models in predicting residential occupancy, offering valuable insight into two approaches to occupancy modeling. The Random Forest model performs exceptionally well in capturing occupancy trends, while the Bayesian Network model, combined with expert knowledge, provides detailed predictions of occupancy types and zones. The research also addresses challenges related to data collection, including privacy concerns. It presents effective occupancy modeling strategies for residential energy management
